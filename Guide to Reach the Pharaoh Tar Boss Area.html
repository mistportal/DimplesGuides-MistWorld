  <h1>Step-by-Step Guide to Reach the Pharaoh Tar Boss Area</h1>
  <p><em>Written by Ginger;Mage ID 2444</em></p>
  <h2>Step 1:</h2>
  <p>Find your way to the entrance of Corpse Cave. Now, start by heading east until you reach a northeast turn.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 2:</h2>
  <p>Continue north until you hit the second west-t-shape.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 3:</h2>
  <p>Head east again until you reach an east-t-shape.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 4:</h2>
  <p>Proceed north until you hit another second west-t-shape.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 5:</h2>
  <p>Keep going east until you hear your zone change to abrupt gravel. This means you are on the right path.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 6:</h2>
  <p>Continue east until you pass through a stone door and enter a corridor.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 7:</h2>
  <p>Keep heading east until you encounter a west T-shape. You are now on the western corridor of a big square.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 8:</h2>
  <p>Travel north for a significant distance until you find a North East turn.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 9:</h2>
  <p>Head all the way east until you reach a South West turn.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 10:</h2>
  <p>Go south until you reach an East T-shape.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 11:</h2>
  <p>Now, go west, and you will pass through a secret door onto stone steps of the secret path.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 12:</h2>
  <p>You'll arrive at another small map. Move around the outside of the square again, following the eastern corridor.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 13:</h2>
  <p>Go north to the north-west turn and then head west.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 14:</h2>
  <p>Continue west all the way to the north-east turn, and then proceed south.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 15:</h2>
  <p>To make it easier, align yourself with the western wall so that the zone reads "stone ladder entrance." Alternatively, if you are close enough, you can press Shift and the left brace key "{" on the keyboard to mark the stone ladder entrance. This will act as a beacon.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 16:</h2>
  <p>Almost there, head west through the stone ladder entrance, and you'll find a north-west turn.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 17:</h2>
  <p>Go north to the north-east turn, and just a few steps east from there, you'll reach the main entrance to the boss area.</p>
  
  <h2>Step 18:</h2>
  <p>Save a Butterfly spot here.</p>
  
  <h2>Notes:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Be cautious as you navigate through doorways. They may lead to square rooms that are purely decorative chambers. If you end up in one of these rooms, simply backtrack through the door and continue on your path.</li>
    <li>Decorative chambers are usually found near turns and t-shapes, so be aware that this might cause some confusion.</li>
  </ul>
