  <h1>Tutorial: Frost Mage Combo Attacks in Mist World</h1>
  <h3>Created by Ginger (Frost Mage, User ID: 2444)</h3>
  <h2>Introduction:</h2>
  <p>
    In Mist World, combo attacks are a crucial aspect of maximizing a Frost Mage's abilities. A combo attack is a sequence of actions that result in a powerful burst of damage or a significant power boost. This tutorial aims to explain how to effectively utilize combo attacks as a Frost Mage, specifically focusing on various combo techniques. It is recommended for mages up to level 65, although lower-level players can still benefit from the information provided.
  </p>
  <h2>Combo Attacks Explained:</h2>
  <p>
    A combo attack consists of a small group of actions that lead to a devastating effect on the target. In the case of Frost Mages, combos can greatly enhance their damage output. Understanding the mechanics behind these combos is vital for optimizing your mage skills. Let's explore the different combo attacks and how to execute them efficiently.
  </p>
  <h2>Combo 1: Frost Nova + Ice Lance</h2>
  <p>
    This combo attack is devastating, especially against physical classes like hunters, orcs, and warriors. It requires the Frost Nova skill, which freezes the target for 5 seconds and applies a condensed effect. The condensed effect is essential for triggering the combo. However, there are some limitations to consider:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Frost Nova has a limited range of 8 yards, so you need to be relatively close to your target.</li>
    <li>Any damage dealt to the target after Frost Nova is cast will break the condensed effect, making the combo ineffective if others are attacking the target. It is most effective when fighting alone or with skilled players who understand mage combos.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    To optimize the use of this combo, it's recommended to inform your team in advance. Setting up a quick phrase to alert them before using Frost Nova can greatly improve coordination and ensure successful combo execution.
  </p>
  <h2>Combo 2 (Requires Ice Finger Talent): Aqua Jet + Ice Arrow + Ice Lance</h2>
  <p>
    This three-step combo attack relies on the Ice Finger talent and is highly effective, especially against bosses. Here's how it works:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Begin by casting Aqua Jet on the target. Aqua Jet is a damage-over-time skill that lasts for 6 seconds, causing continuous damage to the target.</li>
    <li>During the Aqua Jet effect, the target will make a teeth-chattering shivering sound and be under a condensed effect.</li>
    <li>Utilize Ice Arrow immediately followed by Ice Lance. If all three skills hit the target, a combo effect will be triggered, resulting in significant damage similar to the Frost Nova + Ice Lance combo.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This combo is advantageous because only the cast of Ice Arrow can be interrupted, making it suitable for situations where the target is not focused on you. However, be aware that using this combo will draw a lot of threat, especially against powerful bosses. Consider using Ice Barrier immediately after the combo and let your team members redirect the boss's attention.
  </p>
  <h2>Combo 3 (Requires Ice Finger Talent): Critical Ice Arrow + Ice Lance</h2>
  <p>
    This combo attack allows for long-range damage (20 yards) and relies on critical hits. Follow these steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Continuously use Ice Arrow on the target.</li>
    <li>As soon as you score a critical hit with Ice Arrow, immediately cast Ice Lance.</li>
    <li>This combo will trigger, resulting in devastating damage, especially when you have built up several ice spikes.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Remember that Ice Arrow can be interrupted, so it's crucial to always follow up with Ice Lance after a critical hit to maximize damage output.
  </p>
  <h2>Combo 4 (Requires Ice Finger Talent, Level 65 and above): Critical Ice Orb + Ice Lance</h2>
  <p>
    Similar to Combo 3, this combo attack requires critical hits, but with Ice Orb as the primary skill. Here are the details:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use Ice Orb, an instant and uninterrupted attack, from a long range of 20 yards.</li>
    <li>If Ice Orb scores a critical hit, quickly follow it up with Ice Lance to trigger a powerful long-range combo. The damage output will be even higher if you have built up ice spikes.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    There are a few drawbacks to this combo. Ice Orb has a cooldown of 15 seconds and relies on a significant amount of critical hit chance. Additionally, Ice Orb is an area-of-effect (AOE) skill, hitting multiple targets in a 90-degree wave. This means that although you may get critical hits on several targets, the intended target for the combo might not be affected. Please correct me if I'm mistaken on this point.
  </p>
  <h2>Combo Quick Reference:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Frost Nova + Ice Lance</li>
    <li>Aqua Jet + Ice Arrow + Ice Lance (requires Ice Finger talent)</li>
    <li>Ice Arrow + Ice Lance (requires Ice Finger talent, Ice Arrow must crit)</li>
    <li>Ice Orb + Ice Lance (requires Ice Finger talent, Level 65 and above, Ice Orb must crit)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Combos 2, 3, and 4 all require the Ice Finger talent (level 59 skill), while Combo 1 can be used even at low levels.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>
    I hope this tutorial has provided valuable insights into mastering combo attacks as a Frost Mage in Mist World. Remember to adapt your strategies based on your level and available skills. Don't hesitate to provide feedback and inform me of any mistakes I may have made. Feedback is essential for continuous improvement. Now, go forth and annihilate your enemies with your newfound knowledge and skills!
