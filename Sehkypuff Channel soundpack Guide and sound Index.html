    <title>Sehkefypuff Channel Soundpack Guide with Sound Index</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The following sound pack has been compiled from other packs used in audio games or MUDs to enhance accessibility. The default files in Mist World are too quiet and a little bland. This pack features recognizable sounds that you've likely heard before. Sehkef has curated this collection, referred to as the Sehkefypuff Channel Soundpack. The download button for the soundpack is at the bottom of the page, just press B!</p>

    <h1>Installation Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>If you use English as your main language in the game, do not rename the folder, simply copy the English folder and paste it into the sound folder of your Mist World directory and restart the game.</li>
        <li>If you use another language like Spanish, rename the folder accordingly.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, enter the English folder, select all the sounds, and copy them.</li>
        <li>Navigate to your Mist World directory and enter the "sounds" folder.</li>
        <li>Inside the "sounds" folder, create a new folder named after the language you use in the game.</li>
        <li>If you already use custom sounds and have completed this step before, simply enter this folder and paste the sounds.</li>
        <li>Restart Mist World to apply the changes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now you'll have clear stereo sounds to distinguish all your channels. Enjoy the enhanced experience!</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> All sounds are in .ogg format to reduce file size. There is one sound file in .wav format (team sound) that only works in .wav due to technical reasons.</p>

    <h1>Channel Sound Index</h1>

    <p>This information is also available in the SID.ini file located in your config folder within the Mist World directory, but as they were likely translated from Chinese, they are not labelled very well. Feel free to replace sounds according to these IDs if desired.</p>
